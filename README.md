# Personality-detection

This GitHub repository contains two files aimed at exploring and analyzing personality data:

1. **personality_eda_visualization.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a dataset related to the five big types of personality. The notebook begins with an overview of the dataset, including its structure and features. It then delves into EDA techniques to gain insights into the distribution of personality types, exploring correlations between personality traits, and identifying trends based on demographics such as country of origin. Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and geographical maps are used to effectively communicate the findings.

2. **personality_math_eda_xgboost.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file focuses on the mathematical side of personality analysis and includes further exploratory data analysis along with the development of a machine learning model. The notebook explores correlations between different personality traits using statistical methods and visualizations. Additionally, it includes the training of an XGBoost model on the dataset to predict the personality type of users based on their responses to a survey. The notebook covers preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.
